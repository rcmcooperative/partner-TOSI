This repository details the development and design of a community engagement strategy for Open Science at [The Neuro, McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/). 

This work has been comissioned by The Neuroâ€™s [Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI)](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/open-science/tanenbaum-open-science-institute-tosi), under the Open Scientist in Residence Program, September - December 2025.

## Project Vision and Mission
**Vision:** A resilient, sustainable and growing community of open scientists at The Neuro.

**Mission:** Empowering the community, in partnership with TOSI, to make engaged and sustainable contributions to open science.

## About

TOSI have been actively engaged in activities to foster the adoption of open science practices at The Neuro (Montreal Neurological Institute-Hospital) and beyond since 2016. 

The mission is to:

1.  Establish best practices, develop tools, and develop infrastructure to support open science at The Neuro;

2.  Encourage and support other Canadian neuroscience Institutes to embrace this new way of doing research.

To date TOSI have supported a broad range of initiatives including large scale infrastructure, financial rewards for engagement with open science practices,  community-lead training initiatives, and patient engagement activities. 
There has been variable uptake and success of these initiatives, and indications that the best practices of open science are failing to reach the full spectrum of staff members, students and researchers at The Neuro. 
The aim of this proposal is to develop an expert community strategy which supports the mission of TOSI, incorporating evidence and understanding gained over the last nine years of their operations.

A more detailed background is available in the [Proposal for Open Scientist in Residence Program (OSRP) 2025](./docs/proposal-OSRP-RCMCoop.md).

## Developing in the open
This  project is being "developed in the open", with ongoing work made publicly accessible and transparent from the start. This necessitates that some materials are incomplete, under review, or liable to change. 
This state is indicated at the top of every relevant file. 

This transparency is an intentional approach to empower the community by (1) building trust in the process, (2) facilitating engagement, and (3) demonstrating our open science principles. 
1. **Trust**: Since this work is being carried out for the benefit of the community, we believe the work should be available to you for inspection as appropriate.
You, the community, are our client.
2. **Engagement**: Transparency about our ongoing activities allows you to see the exact point where your diverse expertise, priorities and contributions align with the project's timeline and goals. 
This should make it easier for you to contribute.
3. **Open Science Principles**: Our overarching mission is to support the community towards the adoption of open science practices. By demonstrating our open science principles here we are providing an example of how this work can be undertaken with high regard for inclusion, transparency and reproducibility. 

### As open as possible, as closed as necessary
All project material, including both quantitative and qualitative data, will be shared as openly as possible, but as closed as necessary to protect individuals and the integrity of the process.

#### Quantitative Data (Metrics and Aggregates)
Aggregate results, summary statistics, and all non-identifiable metrics will be made public and accessible in a timely manner.

#### Qualitative Data (Opinions and Notes)
Identifiable information will not be shared without the explicit, documented permission of those involved.

The opinions or statements of individual participants will not be shared publicly. 
Opinions will only be shared once they contribute to an indication of consensus ('group opinions'), or when they highlight a matter of particular relevance to the purpose of this project.

Notes of meetings and workshops will remain internal until such a time that they are anonymized and redacted for public sharing.

#### Documentation and Resource Management
To ensure the long-term utility, discoverability, and sustainability of the project outputs, we aim for all resources (including datasets, code, and final reports) will be accompanied by robust and comprehensive documentation. Our goal is for this documentation to adhere [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) best practices, including the use of metadata standards, data dictionaries, and version control.

## Roadmap & Milestones

The strategic analysis is being undertaken following the procedure outlined in the [Proposal for Open Scientist in Residence Program (OSRP) 2025](./docs/proposal-OSRP-RCMCoop.md).
