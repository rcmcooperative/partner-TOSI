# Community mapping
Mapping the community is an essential stage of work to understand who your community are. 
Understanding who they are allows you to understand their perspectives and priorities, and anticipate their needs. 

A community map is also an essential tool for community managers to track engagement, identify opportunities for growth, manage pathways to leadership, and connect individuals or groups with shared interests. 
This work is often done implicitly or informally, and suffers from a lack of reproducibility when there are changes in leadership. 

We advocate for a transparent and reproducible mapping workflow, to optimize the management of large communities. 
Public share of a community map is also a valuable tool for community members to identify themselves and locate others with shared interests.

### 2025-09-29

This phase of work has been brought forward from [the proposal](../../proposal-OSRP-RCMCoop.md) so it can be used to manage contacts for invitation to interview. The structure and settings are broadly being followed as per our [previously developed structure](http://github.com/rcmcooperative/community-mapping). Additional lists have been generated where notes below. 

**Notes these lists contain identifiable information and are accessible only to immediate project members. Sharing is currently managed by [Luisa Pimentel](../../../README.md#team-members)**

- **[Community-list-People](https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/luisa_pimentel_mcgill_ca/Lists/CommunityListPeople)**
    - List of people with contact information. Cross linked to with affiliations, initiatives they lead or participate in, tools they develop or use, and interactions they have attended where this information is available.  
- **[Community-List-Affiliations](https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/luisa_pimentel_mcgill_ca/Lists/CommunityListAffiliations)** 
    - List of organizational units people can be attached to, e.g. Universities, Departments, Labs etc. 
- **[Community-List-Initiatives](https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/luisa_pimentel_mcgill_ca/Lists/CommunityListInitiatives)** 
    - List of initiatives delivered by TOSI or their affiliates. Use to identify which individuals are leaders/participants in a given initiative, or recipients of awards. 
- **[Community-List-Interactions](https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/luisa_pimentel_mcgill_ca/Lists/CommunityListInteractions)**
    - Used to track interactions (for example seminars) delivered by TOSI or their affiliates, to monitor engagement. 
- **[Community-List-Tools](https://mcgill-my.sharepoint.com/:l:/r/personal/luisa_pimentel_mcgill_ca/Lists/CommunityListTools)** 
    - To identify open science tool developers and users, as infrastructure development is a mission area for TOSI. 

The intention is to set this infrastructure up now for use in this project, and to build it out a space for ongoing use by TOSI and initiative leadership to record engagement going forward. A further extension would be self-service submissions to the map by participants/developers/users.

Ongoing training is being provided to Luisa, and further documentation on usage will be developed.

The sharepoint lists have been shared with [Cass' RCM Cooperative email](../../../project-management/communications/channels.md#email)). 

### 2025-10-02

Sharepoint list work shared at TOSI team meeting. Annabell approves continued development and review of Initiatives and Tools list by Luisa for completeness.

### 2025-10-07

The sharepoint lists have been shared with [Cass' McGill email](../../../project-management/communications/channels.md#email)) now this is available. This has been necessary as Cass was previously unable to to make or edit the look-up columns which are essential for linking elements.

Luisa has reviewed the Initiative list and made amendments. Luisa is also supporting data entry for email addresses, initiative leadership and tool contacts.

### 2025-10-15

Double checked permissions to access the lists before this repo is made public. 
Links above have been updated and all previous links deleted. (this document has not yet been pushed, so no links have been published in previous versions before this verification step).
Note the links are all in Luisa's private Sharepoint area.
Suggest this is moved to a TOSI group area for improved long-term fidelity of access.

Luisa is continuing to add email addresses. 
Cass will do a big push on this so interview invites can be sent ASAP.
