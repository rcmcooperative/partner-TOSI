# Interaction Observations
Cass is joining a variety of the interactions hosted by, for, and with relevance to TOSI, to observe the norms of behavior with respect to best practice in open science and research community management. 
Learnings from these observations will be incorporated into the community strategy development where they support the objectives of the community. 

Live notes on these observations are held [here (access restricted)](https://hackmd.io/@rcm-coop/S1etoBARee)

## Themes from observations
These will remaining internal to TOSI until [after the diagnosis phase](../../../README.md#milestone-4-diagnosis-baseline) to avoid biasing potential interview participants.

Summaries drafting in ~./private/community-objective-summaries.md. These will be made public after data collection.
