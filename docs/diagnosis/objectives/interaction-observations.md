# Interaction Observations
Cass is joining a variety of the interactions hosted by, for, and with relevance to TOSI, to observe the norms of behavior with respect to best practice in open science and research community management. 
Learnings from these observations will be incorporated into the community strategy development where they support the objectives of the community.
