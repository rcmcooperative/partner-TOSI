# Community Interviews

## Take part
**We are pleased to speak with any member of The Neuro community about their experiences with open science.**
Your perspective will be incorporated into a set of objectives for the community going forward. 

**To participate in these interviews, please [schedule some time with Cassandra Gould van Praag here](https://calendar.app.google/k7za8eZ6Ffurq7JeA).**
Please specify "Neuro Open Science Interviews" in your booking. Interviews will be held online unless you request otherwise.

### 2025-11-04

6 interviews completed, 6 further booked. 

There are a large number of community sub-groups (as below), with intersectionality on each division. This has brought a lot of different perspectives. 
Some of these groups have been observed (e.g. tool developers at lab tours), but interviews are understandably revealing valuable depth. 

Sub groups:
- PI
- MD
- PhD
- Post doc (staff)
- Grad student
- Under grad
- Committee member (GRC, TC)
- Award recipient
- Tool developer
- OS engaged (self selection into the interview process)


Summaries of these to date currently recorded in private directory to avoid bias. 
Summaries drafting in ~./private/community-objective-summaries.md. These will be made public after data collection.

### Team meeting 
- I suggested that we pull the community event we had tabled for w/b 17th November, for the following reasons:
1. Significant reduction in administrative resource available due to staffing changes at TOSI
2. Prioritize further interviews to improve chances of reaching consensus across diverse population
3. While these events had been planned to build ideas around new initiatives, it may be more appropriate for this group to conduct expert review at this early stage and bring in the community for a later process (e.g. to co-design or approve suggestions)

- Aiming to push for a further 2 weeks of interviews.
- I will do another mail-out, and look to connect with Research Group leaders for any opportunities to present (be visible)
- Once The map is visualized, I will also use this to specifically target core groups

### 2025-11-18
- Compiling themes in kumu syntax to create a mind map ~./private/community-objectives-kumu.xlsx
- Added themes from observations, interviews and meetings into a single space. 
- Careful not to add conclusions of Lab Tours to my identified themes, to avoid circularity - hope to show independent and complementary alignment as both exercises focused on different sub-groups of the community. 

### 2025-11-19
- Leading a reflections exercise at upcoming GRC on incentives to contribute to OS. Contributions at https://tinyurl.com/TOSI-GRC-2025-11 (confidential, password protected)
