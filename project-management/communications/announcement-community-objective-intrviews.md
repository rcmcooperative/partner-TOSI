# Introducing TOSI's Open Scientist in Residence

TOSI have welcomed the 2025 Open Scientist in Residence, Dr Cassandra Gould van Praag, to review TOSIs community strategy for open science. At the end of her residency in December 2025, Cassandra will share a detailed report containing a concrete analysis of all TOSI programs, strategy and  community needs, with concrete recommendations for improving TOSIs programs - creating new ones or eliminating them, if necessary.

**Cassandra is currently hosting 1-2-1 interviews with members of The Neuo to understand your priorities for open science - you are invited to [book a confidential online interview here](https://calendar.app.google/k7za8eZ6Ffurq7JeA) (Please specify "Neuro Open Science Interviews" in your booking).**

Cassandra has a pedigree in open neuroscience and community building, having established the [open science community at the Oxford Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging](https://open.oxcin.ox.ac.uk/pages/open-science/community/Open-WIN-Community/) (previously known as the Welcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging) and co-Chaired the [OHBM Open Science Room in 2020](http://ohbm.github.io/osr2020/), marking a turning point the structure and delivery of that core event for the neuroimaging community. She subsequently lead research communities at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/cassandra-gould-van-praag), and recently Co-Founded [RCM Cooperative](https://www.rcmcooperative.com), to work directly with and for communities to develop their capacity for collaborative research. 

Of this project, Cassandra says, "It is an honour to spend time with The Neuro community, given their early and instrumental commitment to open science. This is an exciting opportunity to take stock of their successes and challenges, and foreground the perspectives of the varied community in the next phase of work. 

This project is being developed openly and for the benefit of The Neuo community - take a look at the [project roadmap](https://github.com/rcmcooperative/partner-TOSI/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#rcm-cooperative-strategy-for-community-engagement-in-open-science-at-the-neuro) and [contributing guide](https://github.com/rcmcooperative/partner-TOSI/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see where your perspective can be incorporated.
